           I first started Coding while obtaining my Bachelor's of Science in Information Systems at
           The University of Texas at Arlington, where I was able to gain experience with: Python, Java, SQL,
           as well as platforms like SAP, Tableau.
           <br></br>
           <br></br>
           While studying for my Bachelor's I took a number of classes that allowed me the opportunity
           to obtain an Associates Degree in Science from El Centro College (Now Dallas College).
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
